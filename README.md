## Problem Statement:
An ML model that detects different diseases using photos of plant leaves.

Dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data.

## Installation:
Clone the repository.

install tensoflow, pandas and seaborn using pip.

Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data and save the folders in the same directory as the model.

run the plant_disease_detection.ipynb in jupyter or VScode or Google Colab.

Edit the path of image in Model_testing.ipynb to the path of the image you are trying to detect the disease for.

run the Model_testing.ipynb in jupyter or VScode or Google Colab.

The last cell should output the disease predicted for your image.

Note: The kaggle dataset also includes testing data if you want to run it for that.
